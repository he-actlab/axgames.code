This repository contains all the source code developed in the AxGames project.

To develop the AxGames framework, we used Python Flask, Jinja, HTML, Javascript, and Postgres Database. You can find the code for this implementation in game.flask directory. 

The db.backup directory has Postgres dump file that you can import into your postgres database and see the statistics similar to ones that reported in the paper. The difference comes from the new statistics collected after the paper submission. 

The etc directory contains image generator and image processing kernels that we used to produce the image inputs for the experiments.
